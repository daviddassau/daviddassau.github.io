          	<p>No… but I'd like to be asked! No… but I'd like to be asked! No… but I'd like to be asked! I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</p>
			<p>What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" Not tricks, Michael, illusions. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?</p>
			<p>No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.</p>
			<p>Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>

          	<p>Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I have a dark side, too. Keep your mind limber. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. God created pudding, and then he rested.</p>
			<p>Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm partial to air conditioning. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</p>
			<p>Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. You look…perfect. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Keep your mind limber. You all right, Dexter?</p>
			<p>Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.</p>

			<p>Who's that then? You don't vote for kings. Well, she turned me into a newt. Who's that then? Why?</p>
			<p>Well, I didn't vote for you. Well, we did do the nose. She looks like one. Camelot! The nose?</p>
			<p>Camelot! Well, she turned me into a newt. He hasn't got shit all over him. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! He hasn't got shit all over him.</p>
			<p>Look, my liege! Be quiet! Well, how'd you become king, then? Why? He hasn't got shit all over him. What do you mean?</p>

          	<p>Don't underestimate the Force. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Red Five standing by. Ye-ha! You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</p>
			<p>What!? Don't underestimate the Force. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
			<p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
			<p>What!? I'm trying not to, kid. I call it luck. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>

          	<p>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!</p>
			<p>Please do not offer my god a peanut. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Save me, Jeebus. I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children.</p>
			<p>A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice. Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! I didn't get rich by signing checks.</p>
			<p>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Duffman can't breathe! OH NO! I hope I didn't brain my damage. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"</p>
