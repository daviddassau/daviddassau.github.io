                <p>Back to school, back to school, to prove to myself that I&rsquo;m not a fool.<br /><br />I was pretty nervous about going back to school, for several reasons. First of all, I never performed exceptionally well academically. In laymen&rsquo;s terms, I&rsquo;m kind of stupid. Well, not stupid per se, but it does take me a little while to catch on. Secondly, I was going back to school for web and software development, which is a field that I&rsquo;ve always struggled with. I love working with code, but I always found myself quickly discouraged. I would constantly hit road blocks where I didn&rsquo;t really understand what I was looking at, or what was being taught to me. But on the other hand, school WAS the silver lining. Up until now, most of my coding education has been self-taught, so I was also excited to be in an actual classroom setting, with physical teachers, surrounded by fellow classmates with more than likely the same questions I have.<br /><br />The first day of class was on Saturday, July 8th 2017. Most of the day served as an orientation to how things were going to go for the next 12 months, and what we can expect to happen. My feelings ranged from happiness, to fear, to elation, to despair, to excitement. And we hadn&rsquo;t even gotten into any of the material yet!<br /><br />Putting aside all of my personal feelings about going back to school for development, I&rsquo;d love to touch on the diversity of my classmates. This was something I was curious to learn. It&rsquo;s no big secret that the tech industry isn&rsquo;t really just for Asians, Indians, and weird looking white guys. It&rsquo;s for everyone! So I was very excited to walk into class on the first day, and see that I had struck the diversity jackpot. In fact, if I hadn&rsquo;t have known that this was a class/school for web and software development, I would have thought it was your typical general education class down at Nashville State Community College. There were folks young and old, black and white, male and female. It was genuinely really cool to know I would be a part of this learning environment.<br /><br />I left school that day with the same feelings and attitude as I did when I walked in: nervous, but excited. I&rsquo;ll be happy and content if those feelings stay the same.</p>
