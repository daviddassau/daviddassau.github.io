                <strong>Content Migrator</strong>
                <br />My job role at HCA was to migrate content from old hospital websites to new mobile responsive one-page templates.
                On a daily basis, I utilized my HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 3 skills in order to make the new hospital sites
                look modern, up-to-date, and easy to use for all audiences.</p>

                <strong>Email Specialist</strong>
                <br />As an Email Specialist, I use HTML and CSS to code emails, primarily for automotive dealerships. I use media
                queries to make sure that our custom emails are mobile-responsive for our clients. Once coding is complete,
                I use Email On Acid, or EOA, to test the coded email across all browsers and email clients, such as Apple
                Mail, Outlook, Gmail, iPhone, iPad, and Android.</p>
